# Project Proposal




## Description
I'm going to build a [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) game UI. Users can play games either with another user or against AI. Users can also save a game and replay it later.


## Background Knowledge
I'll need to build a UI with functions including selecting opponent, starting a game, saving a game, replaying a past game, and retracting a move. To implement an AI, I'll probably write a game tree on my own; I hope the AI will beat human players in most cases.


## External Libraries
- ofxButtons
- ofxNotifications


## Timeline
- Week 1: Finish UI. Users can play with one another.
- Week 2: Finish AI strategy. Users can play with AI.
- Week 3: Add features such as replay.
- Week 4: Decorate the board and add sound tracks.


## Stretch Goals
I'll add network features so that users can play games online.
